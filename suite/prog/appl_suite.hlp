1  suite

   The discus_suite program integrates the stand alone programs
   DISCUS DIFFEV and KUPLOT into one common program.

2  Summary

   You can switch to the individual sections "discus", "diffev",
   and "kuplot" by typing the respective section name. To return
   to the suite type "exit" at the main menu of each section.

   The variables i[*], r[*] and res[*] are global variables, 
   a change in any section will be seen in any other section 
   as well.
   The same holds for all user defined variables!

   The section specific variables are local within each section.

   If an output filename in "discus" starts with "kuplot", the
   data are written directly into the next available KUPLOT 
   data set. This is available for Fourier output, powder, pdf.
2  News

   This is the first release

2  diffev

   Switches to the "diffev" section. 

   Within this section any standard DIFFEV command can be
   given. The behaviour of "diffev" is essentially the same
   as in the stand alone version. 
   The 'diffev/run_mpi' command will start a discus/kuplot
   section. The syntax of the command is unchanged. 
   All trial parameters are placed into array <r[]> at 
   entries 201, 202, ...
   The values of generation, member, children and number
   of parameters are placed into <i[]>:
   i[201] = generation
   i[202] = member
   i[203] = children
   i[204] = parameter

   Use an 'exit' to return to the suite.
2  discus

   Switches to the "discus" section.

   Within this section any standard DISCUS command can be
   given. The behaviour of "discus" is essentially the same
   as in the stand alone version.
 
   Within the discus section you can use the command
   'branch kuplot' to switch to the kuplot branch.

   In contrast to the stand alone DISCUS version, one can 
   write an output file directly into the KUPLOT data sets.
   The number of data sets in KUPLOT is atumatically incremented. 
   Currently this is implemented for the PDF and the powder
   output. Single crystal diffraction pattern to follow
   shortly.
2  kuplot

   Switches to the "kuplot" section.

   Within this section any standard KUPLOT command can be
   given. The behaviour of "kuplot" is essentially the same
   as in the stand alone version.
 
   Within the kuplot section you can use the command
   'branch discus' to switch to the discus branch.
